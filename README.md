A feasibility chat application in Xamarin.Forms(for Android)
I've created a small chat application in Xamarin.Forms, using the MVVM(free of MVVM frameworks). The user enters in the public chat room and can broadcast messages to other members over the XMPP server. 

###### The application can run in two modes
1. Demo Mode-user enters in chat room and can type messages that will be displayed on the display.
2. Xmpp Mode-clients are connected to an XMPP server(in my case it is Openfire 4.3.2)

###### How To Select These Modes
In "LoginPageViewModel.cs" file, follow the commented instructions starting with the line 1.

###### Tools used
- Xmpp Server: Openfire (used 4.3.2 version)
- Xmpp library(client side): Matrix.Android
